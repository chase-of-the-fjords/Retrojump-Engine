# Retrojump 2D Game Engine

This is the Retrojump 2D Game Engine, an engine that I began to make in 8th grade, and continued throughout early college. It's made using Java, and based on tutorials by TheChernoProject.

It was used as the base for most of my Ludum Dare games, including Timeless, Dimmer, The Matter at Hand, Mimic, and several others. According to my notes, it's currently on version 0.15.2, but hasn't been updated in a few years.

To use the engine, export it as a jar and import it into a new Java Project. Typically, when revisiting the engine, I look at past projects for clarity on how everything works. This project is no longer ongoing, and was never intended for use beyond myself, but the documentation is surprisingly rigorous for a project I made as a kid.
